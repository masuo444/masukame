**Japanese Traditional Craft Meets International Luxury: FOMUS Launches MASUKAME, Premium Art Toy Collection for Global Collectors**

---

**TOKYO, JAPAN** – August 3, 2024 – FOMUS, a pioneering Japanese craft company, today announced the international launch of MASUKAME, a luxury art toy collection that bridges traditional Japanese craftsmanship with modern collectible design. Priced at €600, each MASUKAME Classic Edition piece represents a fusion of the Japanese lucky symbols "Masu" (prosperity) and "Turtle" (longevity), handcrafted by master artisans using time-honored techniques.

### The Art of Cultural Fusion

MASUKAME transforms two of Japan's most cherished symbols of good fortune into a contemporary art piece that speaks to global collectors. Each figure is individually crafted from premium Japanese Hinoki cypress wood, known for its durability and aromatic properties. The design philosophy embraces the Japanese aesthetic principle of "mono no aware" – finding beauty in impermanence and imperfection.

"MASUKAME represents our vision of preserving traditional Japanese craftsmanship while creating something that resonates with international art collectors," said MaSU, Founder of FOMUS. "Each piece is not just a collectible, but a bridge between cultures, carrying centuries of Japanese wisdom into modern homes worldwide."

### Artisan Craftsmanship in the Digital Age

In an era of mass production, MASUKAME stands as a testament to the enduring value of handmade artistry. Each figure requires approximately 40 hours of meticulous craftsmanship, from initial wood selection to final finishing. Master artisans employ traditional Japanese woodworking techniques passed down through generations, including:

- **Sashimono** joinery without nails or screws
- **Urushi** natural lacquer finishing techniques  
- **Sumi** ink detailing for symbolic elements
- **Kanna** hand-plane smoothing for perfect surfaces

Every MASUKAME piece bears a unique serial number and comes with authenticity certification through FOMUS's proprietary database system, ensuring collectors receive genuine, traceable artwork.

### Global Luxury Market Positioning

The international luxury collectibles market, valued at over $350 billion globally, has seen increasing demand for culturally significant, handcrafted items. MASUKAME enters this market positioned as a premium offering that combines:

- **Cultural Heritage**: Authentic Japanese traditional craft techniques
- **Investment Potential**: Limited production with serial numbering
- **Artistic Merit**: Museum-quality craftsmanship and design
- **Symbolic Value**: Ancient fortune symbols for modern prosperity

"We're seeing unprecedented global interest in authentic cultural artifacts that tell a story," noted luxury market analyst Sarah Chen. "MASUKAME perfectly captures this trend, offering collectors both aesthetic beauty and cultural significance."
